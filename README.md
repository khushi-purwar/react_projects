Yeahhh!✨, you just made added your first issue. The Maintainer of react_projects will now review your issue and you will either get assigned to the issue, have it closed or a comment will be dropped for you.

You have been assigned an issue 🥂 and are confused 😵 about where to go from here, follow this guide below to make your changes and pull request 🍾.

## Getting Started...

### Steps to clone the Repository

- Fork the react_projects repository.👇

![i5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82704514/194140771-d9b41853-76e4-47ef-b031-378e7835ccda.jpeg)

- Clone the repository you forked above.👇

![i6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82704514/194140974-2a845f67-7616-443b-9c2b-9b639167a7bd.jpeg)

- Using the command below 👇, you can clone the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/vidhichadha2507/react_projects.git
```
- Navigate to the cloned directory using command line.👇

```
cd react_projects
```

- Install all the dependencies.👇

```
npm i
```

- Make a new branch.👇

```
git checkout -b "Your Branch Name"
```

- A good branch name would begin with the issue ticket and the assigned issue. See below 👇

```
// #343 is the issu ticket number and make a request is the assigned issue na

git checkout -b "#343-make a request"
```

Yeahhh, You are all set!! 🍾🎉. You can now make your changes locally. Once you are done making all your changes, you can now push code and make a pull request.

## Steps to make a Pull Request

You have to switch to the main branch and make sure it's up to date with the **react_projects** main branch. To do so, use the following commands below👇.

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/vidhichadha2507/react_projects.git
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

You can now update your branch from your local copy of main, and push it!. See how below. 👇

```
git add .
git commit -m "<your commit message>"
git push origin <name-of-your-branch>
```

Hurray!!, we are done with the hard part. Now Github will check for conflicts and if non is found, you can make the pull request and the mainteners of **react_projects** will review your pull request to have it merged or make a comment on it.

# Code Review Process

The maintainer of **react_projects** looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis and carries out merging or comments on the requests. You can close a pull request if it isn't showing any activity after two weeks.
